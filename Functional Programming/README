These are all my college course files[from january 2021 - november 2021] 
updated to reflect some of the advancements within the python programming language...
most files have test files which can be ran within an IDE or terminal 
as long as a recent version of python is installed on the machine
these functions should work most dont use any 3rd party libraries...
