These are all my college course files[from january 2021 - november 2021] 
updated to reflect some of the advancements within the python programming language
such as unittest implementations, object oriented design, and type hinting
most files have test files which can be ran within an IDE or terminal 
as long as a recent version of python(v3.6+) is installed on the machine
these functions are coded in a way 3rd party libraries are not a requirement
