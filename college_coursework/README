# Various updated python college course files(Jan2021 - Nov2021)

Files within are functions dealing with various data types from
strings, floats, integers, lists, tuples, nested lists( 2d tables ),
sets, dictionaries to files such as  csv and JSON files, as well as
dealing with timezones, time aware objects, etc.

currently updating all my files.  these will include.. 
- unittests, 
- type hinting,
- assert statements(for enforcing the preconditions)
- tuple/list/set comprehensions
- ternary operators and more
- in short better code readability....
